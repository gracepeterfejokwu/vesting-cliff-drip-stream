//! # Vesting Cliff Drip Stream
//!
//! A Soroban smart contract that introduces a time-locked cliff period to a
//! linear token streaming model with fixed-point rate precision.
//!
//! ## How It Works
//! 1. A sponsor deposits the full token allocation upfront into the contract vault.
//! 2. The recipient cannot claim anything until the `cliff_ledger` is reached.
//! 3. Once the cliff passes, all tokens accrued since `start_ledger` unlock instantly.
//! 4. Remaining tokens continue to drip linearly per ledger until `end_ledger`.
//!
//! ## Fixed-Point Rates (Issue #5)
//! `rate_per_ledger` is stored scaled by `RATE_DECIMALS = 10_000_000`.
//! Pass `rate = 10_000_000` for 1 token/ledger, `rate = 5_000_000` for 0.5/ledger.
